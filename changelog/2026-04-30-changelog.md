# Release Notes (2026-04-30)

Today's updates introduce significant improvements to the file browsing experience with hybrid search and improved visibility into update results.

## 🚀 Features
* **Smart File List with Hybrid Search:** Overhauled the workspace and shared directory file browsers. The new "smart" listing defaults to showing the 500 most recently modified files and includes a debounced hybrid search (regex with fuzzy fallback) that queries the backend while merging with local results. (Commit: `163e5a6b`)
