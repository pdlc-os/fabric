# PR #59 Review Feedback Fixes

**Date:** 2026-05-13
**PR:** #59 (fabric/fix-issue-36) - Rename idle state to working
**Commit:** a1602edb

## Summary

Addressed review feedback on PR #59 from code review.

## Issues Addressed

### Medium: Revert old migration modifications (migrationV20, migrationV21)

The PR had modified SQL strings in existing migration functions (`migrationV20`, `migrationV21`) to change `idle` to `working`. Migrations should be treated as immutable historical records. Since `migrationV51` (newly added by the PR) already handles the idle-to-working data transformation at runtime, the older migrations were reverted to their original values.

**Changes:**
- `migrationV20`: Restored `activity = 'idle'` for `status = 'running'` and `status = 'idle'` backfill lines
- `migrationV21`: Restored original backfill line with `'idle'` in the IN clause, removed the separate `'working'` mapping line

### Already Handled: COMPLETED mapping in translate.go (HIGH)

The reviewer flagged a missing `COMPLETED` case in `MapActivityToTaskState()`. This was already present in the code (line 90-91) but outside the diff context window shown to the reviewer.

### Already Handled: COMPLETED test case in translate_test.go (MEDIUM)

The reviewer suggested adding a test for `COMPLETED` mapping. This test already existed (line 32).

## Verification

- `go build ./...` - passed
- `go test ./pkg/store/...` - passed
- `go test ./extras/fabric-a2a-bridge/internal/bridge/...` - passed
