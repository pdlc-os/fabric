# Project Log: Capture Test Baseline

**Date:** 2026-05-09
**Agent:** Developer

## Task Summary
Captured the initial test baseline for the project to document the current state of build and tests.

## Findings

### Build Status
- `go build ./...` passed successfully. All dependencies were resolved and the project compiles.

### Test Status
- `go test ./...` failed across multiple packages.
- Total of 8 packages reported failures:
    - `cmd`
    - `cmd/fabrictool/commands`
    - `pkg/agent`
    - `pkg/config`
    - `pkg/harness`
    - `pkg/hub`
    - `pkg/hubsync`
    - `pkg/store/sqlite`

### Key Observations
1. **Environment Issues**: Some failures (e.g., in `cmd`) are explicitly due to missing dependencies in the test environment, specifically `docker`.
2. **Telemetry and Hub Sync**: A significant number of failures are concentrated in telemetry configuration merging and Hub synchronization logic.
3. **Seeding Discrepancy**: `pkg/store/sqlite` has a regression where 5 maintenance operations are found instead of the expected 4, indicating a possible uncommitted change or an issue with the seeding logic.

## Process Observations
- Dependency downloading during the first `go build` took a significant amount of time.
- The test output is quite large, requiring targeted filtering to identify specific failures.
- Baseline documentation has been saved to `.scratch/phase0-test-baseline.md` for future reference.

## Next Steps
- Investigate the `pkg/store/sqlite` seeding failure as it seems like a straightforward logic/expectation mismatch.
- Address environment-related failures by either mocking the missing tools or ensuring they are available if necessary for those tests.
