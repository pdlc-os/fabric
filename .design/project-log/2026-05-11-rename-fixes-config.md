# Project Log: Rename Fixes and Configuration Compatibility

**Date:** 2026-05-11
**Status:** Completed
**Author:** Developer Agent

## Summary
Implemented critical fixes for settings loading and Hub API backward compatibility as identified in Code Review v5. These changes ensure that the transition from 'grove' to 'project' terminology does not break existing configurations or API clients.

## Work Completed

### 1. Settings Loading Fixes (`pkg/config/koanf.go`)
- Updated `LoadSettingsKoanf` to use `project_id` and `hub.projectId` as the primary keys for koanf remapping.
- Added support for both legacy `grove_id` and new `project_id` in environment variables.
- Implemented `FABRIC_HUB_PROJECT_ID` environment variable support (mapping to top-level `project_id`).
- Ensured that `hub.grove_id` or `hub.project_id` from V1 settings files are correctly remapped to top-level `project_id` and `hub.projectId`.
- Fixed `ReadProjectID` usage to map to `project_id`.

### 2. Hub API Backward Compatibility (`pkg/store/models.go`)
- Implemented `MarshalJSON` and `UnmarshalJSON` for `Project`, `Agent`, and `ProjectProvider` structs.
- Added legacy fields `groveId`, `groveName`, and `grove` to `Project` JSON representation.
- Added legacy field `groveId` to `Agent` and `ProjectProvider` JSON representation.
- This ensures that legacy API clients expecting 'grove' terminology can still interact with the Hub.

### 3. Project Registration Compatibility (`pkg/hub/handlers.go`)
- Added custom `UnmarshalJSON` to `RegisterProjectRequest` to support legacy `groveId` or `grove_id` keys in registration requests.
- Added missing `encoding/json` import to `pkg/hub/handlers.go`.

### 4. V1 Settings Initialization Fix (`pkg/config/init.go`)
- Updated `writeProjectSettings` to use `grove_id` key when writing Hub project ID for `schema_version: "1"` settings.
- This maintains consistency with `V1HubClientConfig` tags in `pkg/config/settings_v1.go`.

## Verification Results
- `go test -v ./pkg/config/ -run TestLoadSettingsKoanf -count=1`: **PASSED** (all 15 subtests)
- `go test -v ./pkg/config/ -run TestV1 -count=1`: **PASSED**
- `go build ./...`: **SUCCESSFUL**

## Findings and Observations
- The `Settings` struct had already been partially updated to use `project_id`, but the koanf remapping logic in `koanf.go` was still targeting the old `grove_id` key, causing tests to fail when checking `s.ProjectID`.
- Several other structs in `models.go` already had similar legacy compatibility layers, making the pattern easy to follow for the remaining core models.
- V1 settings compatibility requires careful mapping because the struct fields were renamed but the serialized keys must remain `grove_id` for on-disk compatibility with existing V1 projects.
