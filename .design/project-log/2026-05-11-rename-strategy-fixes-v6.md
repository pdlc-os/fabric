# Project Log: Rename Strategy Fixes (Code Review v6)

**Date:** 2026-05-11
**Agent:** Developer

## Overview
Addressed several fixes from Code Review v6 on the `fabric/rename-strategy` branch. The changes focus on ensuring consistent support for `project_id` alongside the legacy `grove_id`, improving SSR prefetching in the web server, and updating outdated comments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration (pkg/config)
- **pkg/config/settings_v1.go**:
    - Updated `UpdateVersionedSetting` to support `project_id` and `hub.projectId` by mapping them to the internal `ProjectID` field.
    - Updated `GetVersionedSettingValue` to return `ProjectID` for both `project_id` and `hub.projectId` keys.
- **pkg/config/settings.go**:
    - Updated `GetHubProjectID` comment to use 'project ID' instead of 'grove ID'.

### 2. Hub Web Server (pkg/hub)
- **pkg/hub/web.go**:
    - Cleaned up `resolveAPIPath` by removing duplicate `case` statements for `/projects` and `/projects/{id}`.
    - Added support for the legacy `/groves` path in SSR prefetching by combining it with the `/projects` case.

### 3. Hub Client (pkg/hubclient)
- **pkg/hubclient/projects.go**:
    - Updated the comment for the `ID` field in `RegisterProjectRequest` struct to reflect `project_id`.

## Verification Results
- Ran `go build ./...` successfully. All packages compiled without errors.

## Observations
- The rename from 'grove' to 'project' is being applied incrementally across the codebase, with legacy support maintained for backward compatibility.
- The duplication in `resolveAPIPath` was likely a result of previous merge or refactoring steps.
