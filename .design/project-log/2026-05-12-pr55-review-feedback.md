# PR #55 Review Feedback Fix

**Date:** 2026-05-12
**Branch:** fabric/fix-issue-45
**PR:** #55

## Changes

Addressed three code review items on PR #55 (version field removal from delivery payload):

1. **Field alignment** — Restored tab padding on the `Timestamp` field in both the `deliveryMessage` struct definition and the struct literal in `FormatForDelivery()`. When `Version` was removed, `Timestamp` lost its alignment with the other fields.

2. **Doc-comment update** — Updated both doc-comments (on the struct and on `FormatForDelivery`) to mention that "version" is also stripped at delivery time, not just "recipient".

3. **Negative test assertion** — Added `strings.Contains(result, "version")` check in `TestFormatForDelivery_Structured`, matching the existing pattern for the "recipient" assertion.

## Verification

- `go build ./...` — passed
- `go test ./pkg/messages/ -v` — all 14 tests passed
