# Release Notes — Fabric

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **K8s attach pod name resolution** — `fabric attach` now uses the actual grove-prefixed pod name (e.g., `fabrictest--hello`) instead of the bare agent name, fixing GKE Warden `autogke-no-pod-connect-limitation` errors
- **K8s attach su password prompt** — `fabric attach` no longer prompts for a password on GKE Autopilot pods that run as non-root with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`

### Added
- All container images built and published to Artifact Registry (core-base, fabric-base, fabric-claude, fabric-gemini, fabric-opencode, fabric-codex)
